There's a minimum requirements for an exchange to be integrated in CCD, it needs to have an API to interact with, its performance and downtime have to meet certain quality thresholds.
We've chosen Binance and Kraken mainly because they have been around since the very beginning of cryptocurrencies and they support a large number of users and markets.  
&nbsp;

## Binance

Largest crypto exchange in the world in terms of volume, Binance was founded by Changpeng Zhao in 2017.  
Originally, it was founded in China but moved out due to regulations. Currently its headquarters are located in Malta.  
&nbsp;  
In 2019, Binance was victim of a “large scale security breach” in which hackers had stolen 7.000 Bitcoin worth around 40 million USD at the time. Binance halted further withdrawals and deposits but allowed trading to continue. The site pledged to reimburse customers through its secure asset fund.
